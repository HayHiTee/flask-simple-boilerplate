Flask Simple Boilerplate: For everyone
======================================

This is *probably* the easiest and the most documented flask boilerplate app.
It uses an MVC folder structure and pattern which is a bonus if you're used
to MVC pattern (*you can easily change it if you're not an MVC fan *).
It has all the setup done for you, so you only have to focus on writing your business
logic. It also has installed all the basic libraries installed for you already.
